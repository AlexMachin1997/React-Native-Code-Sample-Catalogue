## Getting started 

* Clone the project to your development environment by using ` git clone https://github.com/AlexMachin1997/RESTful-API-Interface.git`

* Install and configure android studio
    * Install the IDE
    * Click SDK manager within Android Studio settings.
    * Go to the SDK platforms tools and perform the following
        * Click show all package details and go to the latest version of Android
        * Click "Android SDK Platform 28"
        * Click "Sources for Android 28"
        * Click "Intel x86 Atom Ststem Image"
        * Click "Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image"
        * Click "Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image"
        * Click "Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image"
        * Click "Google Play Intel x86 Atom System Image"
        * Click "Google Play Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image"

    * Go to SDK tools tab and perform the following:
        * Click show all package details.
        *  Click "Android SDK Build-Tools"
        *  Click "Android Emulator"
        *  Click "Android-SDK Platform Tools"
        *  Click "Android SDK tools"
        *  Click "Google play services"
        *  Click "Google USB Driver"
        *  Click "Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer)"
        *  Click "Support Respository"
    * Add a virtual device via the AVD manager
    * Check the Android SDK location is correct

* Configure the enviroment variables for Android Studio:
    * Add ANDROID_HOME = `C:\Users\ [USERNAME] \AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`
    * Add `C:\Users\ [USERNAME] \AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools` to the PATH variable within the system and account sections

* Install Node.JS and node package manager(NPM):
    * https://nodejs.org/en/ (Node.JS and NPM)

* Install expo cli and react-native:
    * `npm install -g expo-cli` 

* Physical device configuration:
    * Enable developer mode
    * Enable USB debugging
    * Check the USB configuration is set to MTP
    * Uncheck and recheck the USB debugging (Weird issue during the setup)
    * Run `adb devices`, this should show the devices as the platform tools variable was set earlier
        * If it fails go to `C:\Users\ [USERNAME] \AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools` in the command line and type in `adb devices` again
    * The util should show your device connected, note the name showed in the adb devices output
    * configure adbs reverse `adb -s <Device name from adb devices output> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`
    * Run adb devices again to check everything is ok, your device should show up

* Development enviroment variables setup:
    * Create keys_dev.js within the keys directory
    * After creating the file files add the following code sample: `` module.exports = {} ``
    * More steps coming soon

* Running the development enviroment:
    * Go to the cloned repositories location in the terminal
    * Run `react-native run-android` (This will take a long time on the inital build, but the second time around it will take seconds)
    * If you have the emulator running it will run on that device
    * If you have a physical device attached it will run on that device
    * **Note**: Only one device can run at once



## Testing
Comming soon in a future update


## Deployment notes
To use the API, you can deploy it to various playstores a platforms like:
* [Expo](https://expo.io/)
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_GB)
* [Apple store](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store/)

**NOTE**: The deployment of the application will be different depending on the setup used. For my personal use it will be deployed to Expo and Google Play, though if you want to create an iOS version then you will need to deploy it to Apple store as opposed to Google Play.

## Contributing
